I'm still playing with [luxe](http://luxeengine.com/), and I heard that there is the possibility to turn html5 apps into [Windows Universal Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/dn726767.aspx)(also known as UWA) and I had to try it, even if it's just (from my understanding, anyway) a wrapper around a webview.  
The following steps assume that:

- you have already installed luxe 
- you can build for the `web` target
- you have Visual Studio installed (2013+ should be fine)

Starting from the base empty project, add this to your `Main.hx`

```clike
    ...
    override function ready() {

        var s : Sprite = new Sprite({
            name : "s",
            size: new Vec(48,48),
            pos: Luxe.screen.mid
        });

    } //ready
    ...
```

Now, follow those steps:

1. Build a luxe project for web: `flow build web`  (or `flow run web` if you want to make sure it works by launching it in your browser).
2. Open Visual Studio (I used Visual Studio 2015)
3. Create a new project in Visual Studio : `New Project -> JavaScript -> Blank App (Windows Universal)`, I named it `TestSnowkit`
4. Now grab the `project.js` generated by flow, and copy it into your Visual Studio Project folder
5. Now in Visual Studio, in `Solution Explorer` right click on `TestSnowkit`-> `Add`-> `Existing item`  (or press  `Shift+Alt+A`) and select `project.js`  
(If you need sound, do the same for `howler.js`)
6. Update the `default.html` to reference `project.js`. The other references are not needed, but you can keep them if you want to use some UWA specific feature
7. In Visual Studio, press `F5` to test your project.

```html
    ...
    <body class="win-type-body">
        <p>Content goes here</p>
        <script src="project.js"></script>
    </body>
    ...
```

*modified default.html*

Here's a picture of the project running:
