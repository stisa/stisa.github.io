      <h2><a href="http://silvio.tisato.me/blog/luxe_hooks/">Luxe/Flow Hooks Example</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 02 October 2015</i>
      <p>I&rsquo;m playing around with luxe, building a simple depth first search-based maze generator, which I plan on turning into a full game ( btw you can try it here ). While iterating, I had to copy-paste the content of bin/web/ to the folder linked with the project git repo, but it got old fast, and I had to find a faster way. At first, I tried using the --output-path &lt;path&gt; flag in flow, that overrides the flow tree project.app.output path.</p>

      <h2><a href="http://silvio.tisato.me/blog/starting_with_mint/">Starting with mint</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 20 September 2015</i>
      <p>Today I started experimenting with mint, a library written in the Haxe programming language. It is a fairly new library, with relatively little documentation, but it&rsquo;s also quite straightforward. I pieced together a barebone example from the mint repo , with a window showing a label. Here it is: github</p>

      <h2><a href="http://silvio.tisato.me/blog/kivy_layout/">Kivy Layout</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 11 August 2015</i>
      <p>So I&rsquo;ve started messing around with Kivy, and I was stuck trying to understand just how the layout thing works when using .kv code. And I think I finally understood what I was doing wrong. I was basically setting the layout of the small square that is the default widget size in Kivy so, knowing that, I tried creating the base widget as a layout and it worked :D Example:</p>

      <h2><a href="http://silvio.tisato.me/blog/unity_accelerometer/">Unity3D &amp; accelerometer</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 08 July 2014</i>
      <p>You know that feeling when you spend ours thinking about an issue, and you finally understand something very simple was missing the whole time? Well, I know that feeling very well. accel = Mathf.Round(Mathf.Sqrt( (Input.acceleration.x *Input.acceleration.x) + (Input.acceleration.z * Input.acceleration.z) + (Input.acceleration.y*Input.acceleration.y) )); Outputted 0. Zero. Always, even when shaking the phone. And then I realized Input.acceleration gives a value between 0 and 1, and then rounding down that number always ended up to zero.</p>
