Today I started experimenting with [mint](https://github.com/snowkit/mint), a library written in the
Haxe programming language.  
It is a fairly new library, with relatively little documentation, but it's also quite straightforward.  
I pieced together a barebone example from the mint repo , with a window showing a label.  
Here it is: [github](https://github.com/stisa/mint-example)
