      <h2><a href="http://stisa.space/articles/custom-web-layout/">Snow/Luxe: Custom Web Layout</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 16 December 2015</i>
      <p>Hi everyone, this is just a quick post on a simple thing I found out today. When building for the web target with luxe, the default layout is just a black background with the game window in the middle. While this is okay while developing, I wanted to show a demo of the game on my website, so I wanted its layout to fit with the rest of the site. After a bit of digging (all right, a lot of digging, but only because I thought the layout was in flow, as it is the one responsible of building) I found the default layout inside snow lib folder, snow\flow\web\index.html, where snow is the path in which you installed snow.</p>

      <i class="notes">Stisa, 21 November 2015</i>
      <p>I&rsquo;m still playing with luxe, and I heard that there is the possibility to turn html5 apps into Windows Universal Apps(also known as UWA) and I had to try it, even if it&rsquo;s just (from my understanding, anyway) a wrapper around a webview. The following steps assume that: you have already installed luxe you can build for the web target you have Visual Studio installed (2013+ should be fine) Starting from the base empty project, add this to your Main.hx ...</p>

      <h2><a href="http://stisa.space/articles/luxe-hooks/">Luxe/Flow Hooks Example</a></h2>
      <i class="notes">Stisa, 02 October 2015</i>
      <p>I&rsquo;m playing around with luxe, building a simple depth first search-based maze generator, which I plan on turning into a full game ( btw you can try it here ). While iterating, I had to copy-paste the content of bin/web/ to the folder linked with the project git repo, but it got old fast, and I had to find a faster way. At first, I tried using the --output-path &lt;path&gt; flag in flow, that overrides the flow tree project.app.output path.</p>

      <i class="notes">Stisa, 20 September 2015</i>
      <p>Today I started experimenting with mint, a library written in the Haxe programming language. It is a fairly new library, with relatively little documentation, but it&rsquo;s also quite straightforward. I pieced together a barebone example from the mint repo , with a window showing a label. Here it is: github</p>
