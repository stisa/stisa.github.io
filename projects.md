On this page I'll try to keep track of my ongoing projects.

## Mazes
This is a simple game, I built it while trying to understand depth-first search maze generators.  
Turns out the hardest part is knowing which cells are near each other.  
Built with luxe.

## Jupyter Nim Kernel
A Pretty simple [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) kernel for [nim](http://nim-lang.org).

PS: [This gist](https://gist.github.com/stisa/27b9d2f4aed9c85d7501ea38e15d9865) has a tool to convert a  notebook `.ipynb` file into  
a `.nim` file, keeping `markdown` blocks as `discard` blocks for documentation purposes.
